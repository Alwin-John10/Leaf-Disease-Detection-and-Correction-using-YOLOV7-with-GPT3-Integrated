# Leaf-Disease-Detection-and-Correction-using-YOLOV7-with-GPT3-Integrated

Leaf disease is a major problem in agriculture, as it can lead to significant crop yield losses. In recent years, deep learning techniques have been increasingly used for the detection and classification of plant diseases. YOLO (You Only Look Once) is a popular object detection algorithm that can detect and classify objects in real-time. In this study, we present a leaf disease detection system using YOLO v7. The proposed system is designed to automatically detect and classify leaf diseases in real-time using a deep convolutional neural network (CNN) and provides correction methods using GPT-3 for the detected diseases. The system is trained on a large dataset of plant images to accurately classify the type of disease present in the leaves. The YOLO v7 algorithm is used for its fast and efficient object detection capabilities. The system achieved high accuracy in detecting multiple classes of leaf diseases, including powdery mildew, rust, and blight. The proposed system has the potential to be used as a tool for early detection and correction of leaf diseases, which can help farmers to take preventive measures and reduce crop losses.
